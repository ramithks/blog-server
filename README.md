## Introduction

This project is built using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.

## Features

- **Fast**: Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic).
- **Intuitive**: Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time debugging.
- **Easy**: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.
- **Short**: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration.
- **Robust**: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation.
